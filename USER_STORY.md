Developer's Name: Jamie

1. Idea Drafting:

   Jamie attends a team brainstorming session where they discuss potential
   features and improvements for their application. An idea for a new feature,
   "Dark Mode", is proposed and gets added to the project board as a draft.

2. Issue Creation:

   Over the next week, the design team works on mockups and requirements for the
   "Dark Mode" feature. Once the design is finalized, Jamie converts the draft
   on the project board into a detailed GitHub issue, outlining the
   requirements, design mockups, and expected outcomes.

3. Branch Creation & Feature Branching:

   Jamie creates a new branch from the main branch named feature/dark-mode.

4. Pull Request Initiation:

   After the initial commit on the feature branch, Jamie opens a pull request
   (PR) to merge the feature/dark-mode branch into the development branch. As
   Jamie continues to develop, the PR is updated, allowing team members to see
   the progress and provide early feedback. Automated tests run with each update
   to ensure the new code doesn't introduce bugs.

5. Automated Labeling - Ready to Code:

   An automated process adds a "ready to code" label to the GitHub issue,
   signaling Jamie that it's time to start the coding process.

6. Developer Tagging for Review:

   After some initial development, Jamie feels the feature is taking shape. They
   manually add a tag to the PR, signaling the code reviewers that it's ready
   for review.

7. Code Review:

   Jamie requests a code review on the PR. Two team members, Jordan and Taylor,
   review the code. They provide feedback, ask questions, and suggest
   improvements. Jamie addresses the feedback, making necessary changes to the
   code.

8. Merging & Continuous Integration:

   After receiving approval from both Jordan and Taylor, Jamie merges the PR
   into the development branch. Automated processes build and test the
   development branch to ensure everything integrates smoothly.

9. Release Preparation:

   As the end of the sprint approaches, the team decides to include "Dark Mode"
   in the next release. A release branch named release/v2.5 is created from the
   development branch. Final testing and documentation updates are performed on
   this branch.

10. Tagging and Release:

    The team conducts final testing on the release/v2.5 branch and everything
    looks good. Jamie tags the latest commit on the release branch with v2.5 and
    creates a GitHub release. Release notes are added, detailing the new
    features, improvements, and bug fixes.
