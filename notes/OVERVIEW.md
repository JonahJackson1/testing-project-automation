## High-Level Overview: Master Repository System with Sub-repositories

### **Introduction**:

The Master Repository System is a structured approach to managing a large app's
development using GitHub. It centralizes the main components of the app within a
master repository and delegates specific functionalities or modules to
sub-repositories. This modular approach facilitates parallel development, clear
separation of concerns, and efficient code management.

### **Components**:

1. **Master Repository**:

   - **Role**: Serves as the central hub for the entire app.
   - **Contents**: Contains references (submodules) to all sub-repositories,
     shared assets, configuration files, and build or deployment scripts.
   - **Function**: Primarily for integration, release management, and providing
     a holistic view of the app's state.

2. **Sub-repositories**:
   - **Role**: Each sub-repository represents a distinct module or functionality
     of the app.
   - **Contents**: Source code, assets, and documentation specific to that
     module.
   - **Function**: Independent development, testing, and versioning of specific
     app modules or features.

### **Workflow**:

1. **Initialization**:

   - Set up the master repository.
   - Add existing or new repositories as submodules to the master repository.

2. **Development**:

   - Developers work within specific sub-repositories for feature development or
     bug fixes.
   - Each sub-repository maintains its own commit history, branches, and
     releases.

3. **Integration**:

   - Changes in sub-repositories are periodically pulled into the master
     repository.
   - The master repository tracks the state (specific commits) of each
     submodule.

4. **Release**:

   - Compilation or integration scripts in the master repository gather
     necessary code and assets from sub-repositories.
   - The app is built, tested, and released from the master repository, ensuring
     all modules are compatible and integrated.

5. **Maintenance**:
   - Regular updates are performed on sub-repositories to ensure they're in sync
     with their remote versions.
   - The master repository is periodically updated to reflect the latest stable
     state of all sub-repositories.

### **Advantages**:

- **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns, making the codebase more
  manageable.
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple teams can work on different features
  simultaneously without conflicts.
- **Scalability**: New modules or functionalities can be easily added as new
  sub-repositories.
- **Flexibility**: Modules can be reused, replaced, or removed without affecting
  the entire app.

### **Challenges**:

- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand the submodule workflow.
- **Integration**: Ensuring seamless integration of all sub-repositories during
  releases.
- **Dependency Management**: Handling interdependencies between sub-repositories
  can be complex.

### **Automation & Tooling**:

- Utilize GitHub Actions or bots for automated checks, branch monitoring, and
  changelog generation.
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, building, and deployment from
  the master repository.
- Use dependency management tools to ensure sub-repositories are always in sync
  with required libraries or components.

### **Conclusion**:

The Master Repository System with sub-repositories offers a structured and
scalable approach to developing large apps on GitHub. With the right tooling and
practices, it can significantly streamline the development process and enhance
code quality.

## **Master Repository System Flowchart**:

### **1. Initialize the Master Repository**:

- **What**: Set up the central repository that will oversee all
  sub-repositories.
- **Why**: To have a unified point of reference and management for all
  codebases.
- **Tools**: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket.

### **2. Manage Submodules**:

- **What**: Decide whether to add a new submodule or update an existing one.
- **Why**: To ensure the master repository is always up-to-date with all its
  sub-repositories.
- **Tools**: Git commands (`git submodule add`, `git submodule update`).

### **3. Code Development in Submodules**:

- **What**: Developers work on features or fixes within the respective
  sub-repositories.
- **Why**: Allows for focused and isolated development in each submodule.
- **Tools**: Standard Git workflow, IDEs, code review tools like Gerrit or
  GitHub PRs.

### **4. Integrate Submodule Changes**:

- **What**: After significant progress in a submodule, the changes are
  integrated into the master repository.
- **Why**: To keep the master repository updated with the latest changes from
  all sub-repositories.
- **Tools**: Git commands (`git commit`, `git push`).

### **5. Automated Testing & CI/CD**:

- **What**: Run automated tests and continuous integration processes.
- **Why**: To ensure code quality, functionality, and that no new issues are
  introduced.
- **Tools**: Jenkins, Travis CI, GitHub Actions, CircleCI.

### **6. Prepare for Release**:

- **What**: Compile and integrate code from all submodules, ensuring everything
  is synchronized and ready.
- **Why**: To have a consolidated version of the app with all the latest
  features and fixes.
- **Tools**: Build tools specific to the app's tech stack, Docker for
  containerization.

### **7. Release Decision**:

- **What**: Decide if the codebase is ready for a release.
- **Why**: To ensure that only stable and tested versions of the app are
  released.
- **Tools**: Manual reviews, user acceptance testing (UAT) platforms.

### **8. Deploy & Release**:

- **What**: Deploy the integrated app to production and tag a new release.
- **Why**: To make the latest version of the app available to users.
- **Tools**: Deployment platforms like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and version
  control tags in Git.

### **9. Feedback & Iteration**:

- **What**: Gather feedback on the released app and plan for the next
  development cycle.
- **Why**: Continuous improvement based on user feedback and evolving
  requirements.
- **Tools**: Feedback tools like UserVoice, direct user feedback, analytics
  platforms like Google Analytics.
