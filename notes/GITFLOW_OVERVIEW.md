### **Idea Drafting**:

- **What**:
  - Ideas for new features, enhancements, or fixes are initially drafted on a
    project board.
- **Why**:
  - **Visualization**: Project boards provide a visual representation of the
    development pipeline, making it easier to track progress.
  - **Collaboration**: Team members can discuss, prioritize, and refine ideas in
    a centralized location.

---

### **Idea Validation**:

- **What**:
  - Before converting an idea into an issue, it undergoes a validation process.
    This could involve feasibility checks, market analysis, or user feedback.
- **Why**:
  - **Feasibility**: Ensures that the idea can be technically implemented within
    the constraints of the current system.
  - **Value Proposition**: Validates that the idea adds value to the product and
    is aligned with the company's goals.

---

### **Issue Creation**:

- **What**:
  - Once the idea is fully fleshed out, including design and other necessary
    details, it's converted into an issue.
- **Why**:
  - **Documentation**: Issues provide a detailed description of the task,
    ensuring everyone understands the requirements.
  - **Tracking**: Issues can be assigned, labeled, and tracked, ensuring
    accountability and progress monitoring.

---

### **Dependency Check**:

- **What**:
  - Before starting development, check if the feature or fix has any
    dependencies, like third-party libraries or other features that need to be
    developed first.
- **Why**:
  - **Smooth Development**: Ensures that all required tools and features are
    available before starting the development.
  - **Efficiency**: Reduces the chances of development halts due to missing
    dependencies.

---

### **Branch Creation & Feature Branching**:

- **What**:
  - A new branch is created, linked to the issue. This ensures that the
    development work related to that issue is isolated from other tasks. Instead
    of developing directly on the main branch (often called `main` or `master`),
    every new feature, enhancement, or bugfix is developed on its own branch.
- **Why**:
  - **Isolation**: Separate branches allow for focused development without
    interference from other ongoing tasks.
  - **Traceability**: Linking branches to issues provides clear traceability of
    code changes to specific tasks.
  - **Stability**: The main branch remains stable and deployable at all times.
  - **Parallel Development**: Multiple features or fixes can be developed in
    parallel without interfering with each other.

---

### **Pull Request Initiation**:

- **What**:
  - As soon as the branch is created, a pull request (PR) is opened. This PR
    will propose merging the new branch into a designated target branch
    (release, development, or staging). As soon as a PR is created or updated,
    tests are automatically run to ensure the new code doesn't introduce bugs.
- **Why**:
  - **Early Feedback**: Opening a PR early allows for continuous feedback during
    development.
  - **Integration**: It ensures that the new code will be integrated smoothly
    into the target branch once it's ready.
  - **Quality Assurance**: Ensure that new changes don't break existing
    functionality.
  - **Immediate Feedback**: Developers get immediate feedback if their changes
    pass or fail the tests.

---

### **Automated Labeling - Ready to Code**:

- **What**:
  - An automated process adds a label "ready to code" to the issue, indicating
    to the developer that they can start working on the feature.
- **Why**:
  - **Status Indication**: Labels provide a quick visual indication of the
    status of an issue.
  - **Automation**: Reduces manual steps and ensures timely notifications.

---

### **Documentation & Commenting**:

- **What**:
  - Developers ensure that the code is well-documented and commented. This
    includes inline comments, README updates, and external documentation if
    necessary.
- **Why**:
  - **Clarity**: Helps other developers understand the purpose and functionality
    of the code.
  - **Maintainability**: Makes future changes and debugging easier.

---

### **Regular Refactoring**:

- **What**:
  - Periodically review and refactor the codebase to improve code quality,
    remove technical debt, and ensure maintainability.
- **Why**:
  - **Code Quality**: Keeps the codebase clean and efficient.
  - **Maintainability**: Ensures that the application is easier to update and
    expand in the future.

---

### **Developer Tagging for Review**:

- **What**:
  - Once the developer feels the feature or fix is ready for review, they
    manually add a tag to the PR to notify code reviewers.
- **Why**:
  - **Communication**: Ensures that code reviewers are aware that the PR is
    ready for their attention.
  - **Efficiency**: Streamlines the review process by clearly indicating when a
    PR is ready for review.

---

### **Code Review**:

- **What**:
  - Before a PR is merged, it's reviewed by one or more team members.
- **Why**:
  - **Knowledge Sharing**: Team members become familiar with changes and reasons
    behind them.
  - **Mentoring**: Junior developers can learn from seniors through the review
    process.
  - **Error Detection**: More eyes on the code mean a higher chance of catching
    mistakes or areas of improvement.

---

### **Merging & Continuous Integration**:

- **What**:
  - After the PR is reviewed and approved, it's merged into the main branch. The
    main branch is then automatically built and tested.
- **Why**:
  - **Up-to-date Main Branch**: The main branch always contains the latest
    approved changes.
  - **Ready for Deployment**: After passing all tests, the main branch remains
    in a state ready for deployment to production.

---

### **Staging Deployment**:

- **What**:
  - After merging into the main branch, changes are deployed to a staging
    environment. This environment closely mirrors production but is used
    internally for final checks.
- **Why**:
  - **Final Validation**: Allows for real-world testing without affecting actual
    users.
  - **Bug Detection**: Catches any last-minute issues before they reach the
    production environment.

---

### **Release Preparation**:

- **What**:
  - As the team approaches a release, a separate branch (often called a release
    branch) is created. This branch is dedicated to finalizing the release.
- **Why**:
  - **Focus**: The team can focus on final testing, bug fixes, and documentation
    updates without being disrupted by new features.
  - **Stability**: Ensures that the release is stable and thoroughly tested
    before it reaches users.

---

### **Documentation Updates**:

- **What**:
  - Alongside code documentation, ensure that external documentation, like user
    manuals or API documentation, is updated to reflect the new changes.
- **Why**:
  - **User Support**: Helps users understand and use the new features or
    changes.
  - **Clarity**: Provides a clear and up-to-date resource for users and
    developers.

---

### **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**:

- **What**:
  - Before a release, a select group of end-users tests the new features in a
    production-like environment to ensure they meet requirements and are free of
    critical bugs.
- **Why**:
  - **Validation**: Confirms that the changes meet user expectations and
    requirements.
  - **Quality**: Reduces the risk of post-release issues.

---

### **Backup Before Release**:

- **What**:
  - Before deploying to production, ensure that there's a recent backup of
    critical data.
- **Why**:
  - **Safety Net**: Provides a recovery point in case of unforeseen issues.
  - **Data Integrity**: Ensures data can be restored if something goes wrong
    during the release.

---

### **Tagging and Release**:

- **What**:
  - Once the release is ready, the commit is tagged with a version number. A
    GitHub release is then created using this tag, and any relevant binaries,
    assets, or notes are attached.
- **Why**:
  - **Versioning**: Tags provide a clear version history, making it easy to
    track changes over time.
  - **Documentation**: Releases in GitHub allow for release notes, providing
    users with information about changes, fixes, and new features.

---

### **Post-Release Training**:

- **What**:
  - If the release introduces significant changes or new features, provide
    training or resources to users and stakeholders.
- **Why**:
  - **Adoption**: Ensures users can effectively use the new features.
  - **Support**: Reduces the number of support queries by proactively educating
    users.

---

### **Feedback Loop**:

- **What**:
  - After the release, gather feedback from users and monitor the application's
    performance and error logs.
- **Why**:
  - **Continuous Improvement**: Feedback can be used for future enhancements or
    fixes.
  - **Monitoring**: Ensures that no unforeseen issues arise in production.

---

### **Rollback Strategy**:

    after the release.
- **Why**:
  - **Reliability**: Ensures minimal downtime or user inconvenience in case of
    issues.
  - **Safety**: Allows for a quick response to critical issues.

---

### **Post-Mortem Analysis**:

- **What**:
  - If something goes wrong, especially during a release, conduct a post-mortem
    analysis to understand the root cause and prevent similar issues in the
    future.
- **Why**:
  - **Learning**: Turns mistakes into learning opportunities.
  - **Prevention**: Helps in putting measures in place to prevent recurrence.

---

### **Community Engagement**:

- **What**:
  - If the product has a community (like open-source software), engage with them
    for feedback, contributions, and discussions.
- **Why**:
  - **Collaboration**: Leverages the collective knowledge and skills of the
    community.
  - **Feedback**: Direct user feedback can guide future development priorities.
